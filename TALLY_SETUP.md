# 🚀 Simple Tally Integration Setup

Since the Python script works but the web app doesn't, we'll use a simple proxy server to solve the CORS issue.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Tally is running** and accessible at `localhost:9000` ✅ (Confirmed working with Python)
2. **Node.js installed** on your system
3. **Your web app running** at `localhost:5174`

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install Proxy Server Dependencies

```bash
# In your project directory
npm install express cors axios
npm install -D nodemon
```

### Step 2: Start the Proxy Server

```bash
# Start the proxy server
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Tally proxy server running on http://localhost:3001
📡 Proxying requests to Tally at http://localhost:9000
🔧 Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
📤 Proxy endpoint: http://localhost:3001/tally-proxy
```

### Step 3: Test the Proxy

Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3001/health`

You should see: `{"status":"OK","message":"Tally proxy server is running"}`

### Step 4: Use Your Web App

Now in your web app:
1. Click **"Check Connection"** - Should work without CORS issues
2. Click **"Show Tally Response"** - Should show the raw XML from Tally
3. Company name should be automatically extracted

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Web App** → sends request to `localhost:3001/tally-proxy`
2. **Proxy Server** → forwards request to `localhost:9000` (Tally)
3. **Tally** → responds with XML
4. **Proxy Server** → sends response back to web app
5. **No CORS issues** because proxy is on same origin

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Proxy Server Won't Start
- Check if port 3001 is available
- Ensure Node.js is installed
- Check console for error messages

### Still Getting CORS Errors
- Make sure proxy server is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for the exact error
- Verify the proxy URL in your code

### Tally Connection Fails
- Ensure Tally is running and accessible
- Test with Python script first
- Check proxy server console for detailed errors

## 🎯 What This Solves

- ✅ **CORS Issues** - Proxy handles cross-origin requests
- ✅ **Company Name Extraction** - Should work like Python script
- ✅ **Reliable Communication** - No more browser restrictions
- ✅ **Easy Debugging** - Proxy server shows all requests/responses

## 🔄 Alternative: Keep Python Script

If you prefer, you can also just use the Python script for company name extraction and manually enter it in the web app. The proxy is just to make everything work automatically.
